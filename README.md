# Expense Tracker Backend

A robust and scalable backend API for managing personal expense tracking. Built entirely with JavaScript, this backend service provides secure endpoints for user authentication, expense management, and analytics, making it a perfect foundation for personal finance applications or integration into larger systems.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with JWT authentication.
- **Expense Management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve your expenses.
- **Categories & Analytics**: Organize expenses by categories and view analytic summaries.
- **RESTful API**: Clean, RESTful endpoints for easy frontend integration.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses MongoDB for high-performance data storage (customize if you use another DB).
- **Environment-based Config**: Easily manage development and production settings.
